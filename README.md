## Instructions

Install node 0.11.13+. Using `nvm`, you can install it like this:

nvm use 0.11.13
```

You can also install it directly from http://nodejs.org.

You can either fork this workshop (recommended) or clone it:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/koajs/workshop
cd workshop
```

Then install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install -g mocha
```

Go through each training, which are stored in folders, in numerical older.
Read the `README` file, edit the `index.js` files, then run each test by executing the following:

```bash
mocha --harmony-generators test.js
```

## Learning more than just Koa

Although writing tests is not part of this workshop,
you should still learn how they work.
An important part of creating apps is creating the tests for it.
Inspect the `test.js` files and see how [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
and [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) are used.
You will also see what is expected from your sample apps by reading the tests.

After you finish each training,
you may want to `git commit` so you have a history of what you've done:

```bash
git commit -a -m "i finished training 1!"
```

Many small commits is good practice!

## Workshop

The first 20-30 minutes of the workshop will be a presentation on http://cdn.rawgit.com/jonathanong/koajs/master/index.html followed by a short period of high level question and answers on Koa.
After which, the hands-on workshop will begin.
Any technical questions asked from the point on will be shown to the entire workshop.

There are many rendering utilities for Koa:

- https://github.com/queckezz/koa-views

However, in this example, we'll render using [Jade's API](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#api).

## Exercise

Render `homepage.jade` using Jade's API.
Because we use Jade's `extends` feature,
you probably need to use Jade's asynchronous API as well as the `.filename` option.
